Unit testing
============

This folder contains unit tests of Simba modules.

Each module should have a test suite to verify that the implementation
works as expected. Also, a test suite often gives the programmer a
better understanding of how to use the module. Implementing common use
cases and writing comments greatly enhances the user experiance. Keep
that in mind! =)
