The `Simba` port for ESP8266 was a challange! In short, Simba is
running in a FreeRTOS thread managed by `ESP8266 RTOS SDK`. It works
amaizingly well!

The reason for this kind implementation is simple; it would have been
too much work to reverseengineer the WiFi module communication. The
SDK does the work for us, and that's great. After all, the goal of
this port was to enable the user to use the Simba API on the ESP and
we are satisfied with the somewhat quirky implementation. It shouldn't
affect the performance very much, I hope.
